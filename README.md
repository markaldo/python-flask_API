# Python Flask API - CRUD Operations with SQLite

**A RESTful API built with Python and Flask for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQLite database.**

## Description

This project is a simple RESTful API built using Python and the Flask framework. It provides endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a SQLite database. The API is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates how to create a basic API using Flask and interact with a database.  The `f_pro.py` file contains the Flask application logic, while `pro_db_setup.py` handles the creation and initialization of the SQLite database.

## Key Features

*   **CRUD Operations:** Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in the SQLite database.
*   **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for interacting with the database using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **Flask Framework:** Built using the Flask microframework for Python.
*   **SQLite Database:** Uses SQLite as the database for storing data.

## Files

*   `f_pro.py`: Contains the Flask application code, including the API endpoints and database interaction logic.
*   `pro_db_setup.py`: Creates and initializes the SQLite database.

## Potential Improvements

*   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation to ensure data quality and prevent errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling to provide informative error messages to the client.
*   **Authentication:** Implement authentication to protect the API endpoints.
*   **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
*   **Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure the API is functioning correctly.
